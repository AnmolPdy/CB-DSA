# Problems

###  1. Container with Most Water 
<p> Given an array of N integers representing heights of N vertical lines. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.  <p>

`Input : N = 9, arr = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]`
`Output : 49`

###  2. Merge Sorted Arrays 
<p> Given two sorted array consisting of N and M integers respectively, design an algorithm to merge the two sorted array such that the merged array is sorted. <p>

`Input : N=4 | arrn = [10, 30, 50, 70], M=3 | brrm = [20, 40, 60]`
`Output : [10, 20, 30, 40 ,50 ,60, 70,]`

###  3. Merge Sorted Arrays in O(1) Space
<p> Given a sorted array "A" of size N+M consisting of N integers & another sorted array "B" consisting of M integers, design an algorithm to merge the two sorted array such that the merged array is also sorted  without using any  extra space. <p>

`Input : A = [10, 30, 50, 70, 0, 0, 0], B = [20, 40, 60]`
`Output : [10, 20, 30, 40 ,50 ,60, 70]`

###  4. DNF (Dutch National Flag) Sort
<p> Given an array containing 0s, 1s & 2s design an algorithm to sort the array. <p>

`Input : N=9, arr = [1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1]`
`Output : [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`

###  5. Counting Sort
<p> Given an array of N non-negative integers, design an algorithm to sort  the array such that each array element is <= a given integer K.<p>

`Input : N=9,K=3, arr = [1, 0, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2]`
`Output : [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`

###  6. Rain-Water Trapping
<p> Given an array of N integers representing height of N buildings, find the total amount of rainwater that can be trapped between the building such width of each building is 1 unit.<p>

`Input : N=12, arr = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
`Output : `

###  7. Product of Array Except Self
<p>Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.<p>

`Input : N=5, arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
`Output : [120, 60, 40, 30, 24] `
